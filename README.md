# React + Vite Project

This is a lightweight, fast React app built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for modern frontend development.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

Follow these steps to clone, install, and run the project locally.

### 0. Install Node.js (if you don’t have it)

To check if Node.js is installed, run:
